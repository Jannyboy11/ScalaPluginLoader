# Java Example

Why an example ScalaPlugin in Java?
Because the Java language evolves with the JVM! This is allows me to test new VM/Bytecode features
that are not supported by the Scala compiler yet.

Some examples include, but are not limited to:
- sealed classes
- records
- nest-based access control
- constant dynamic
